# Family-Tree-Structure-using-Prolog-language
Our aim of this project is, we have to integrate two languages, Pro-log
and Python. We made two interfaces for that purpose, front-end and backend interface. We will do back-end work on pro-log and front-end work on
python. We did this in order to provide ease to the user so that he can run
any of his/her query without any difficulty. Using this mechanism, we solved
a problem of family tree of "Khan Family". User can enter the query without
any difficulty and get the relationship between family members.
